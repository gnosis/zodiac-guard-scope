# ScopeGuard Setup Guide

This guide shows how to setup a ScopeGuard with a Gnosis Safe on the Rinkeby testnetwork.

_Note: transaction guards only work with safes on version 1.3.0 or greater._

## Warning ⚠️

Enabling a ScopeGuard can brick your Safe, making it unusable and rendering any funds inaccessible.
Once enabled on your Safe, your ScopeGuard will revert any transactions to addresses or functions that have not been explicitly allowed.

Before you enable your ScopeGuard, please make sure you have setup the ScopeGuard fully to enable each of the addresses and functions you wish the multisig owners to be able to call.

Best practice is to enable another account that you control as a module to your Safe before enabling your ScopeGuard.

## Prerequisites

To start the process you need to create a Safe on the Rinkeby test network (e.g. via https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io). A Safe transaction is required to setup the ScopeGuard.

Before anything else, you'll need to install the projects dependencies by running `yarn`.

```bash
yarn
```

And then compile the contracts with `yarn build`.

```bash
yarn build
```

For the hardhat tasks to work the environment needs to be properly configured. See the [sample env file](../.env.sample) for more information.

## Deploying the ScopeGuard

The guard only has one attribute which is:
- Owner: address that can call setter functions 

Hardhat tasks can be used to deploy a ScopeGuard instance. There are two different ways to deploy it, the first one is through a normal deployment and passing arguments to the constructor (without the `proxied` flag), or, deploy the Module through a [Minimal Proxy Factory](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) and save on gas costs (without the `proxied` flag) - The master copy and factory address can be found in the [zodiac repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/src/factory/constants.ts) and these are the addresses that are going to be used when deploying the module through factory.

_Note: Multiple safes can use the same instance of a ScopeGuard, but they will all have the same settings controlled by the same `owner`. In most cases it is preferable for each safe to have its own instance of ScopeGuard._

An example for this on Rinkeby would be:
```bash
yarn hardhat setup --network rinkeby --owner <owner_address>
```

or

```bash
yarn hardhat setup --network rinkeby  --owner <owner_address> --proxied true
```

This should return the address of the deployed Scope Guard. For this guide we assume this to be `0x3939393939393939393939393939393939393939`

Once the module is deployed you should verify the source code (Note: If you used the factory deployment the contract should be already verified). If you use a network that is Etherscan compatible and you configure the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in your environment you can use the provided hardhat task to do this.

```bash
yarn hardhat verifyEtherscan --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --owner <owner_address>
```

### Setting up the ScopeGuard

⚠️ Warning, this step is critical to ensure that you do not brick your Safe.

Allow any target addresses that the multisig owners should be allowed to call.

#### Allow a target address

```bash
yarn hardhat allowTarget --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --target <target_address>
```

You should use this command once for each address that the multisig owners are allowed to call.

#### Limit the scope of an address

To limit the scope of an address to specific function signatures, you must toggle on `scoped` for that address and then allow the function signature for that address.

```bash
yarn hardhat toggleScoped --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --target <target_address>
```

You can use this utility to generate the function signature for specific functions.

```bash
yarn hardhat getFunctionSignature --function <escaped_function_sighash>
```

Then set allow the specific function signature.

```bash
yarn hardhat allowFunction --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --target <target_address> --sig <function_signature>
```

An exampe of an escaped function sighash is `balanceOf\(address\)`.

#### Allow delegate calls to an addresses

To allow the multisig owners to initiate delegate call transactions to an address, you must explicitly enable it for that target address.

```bash
yarn hardhat allowDelegateCall --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --target <target_address>
```

#### Transferring Ownership of the guard

Once you have set up your guard, you should transfer ownership to the appropriate address (usually the Safe that the guard will be enabled on).

```bash
yarn hardhat transferOwnership --network rinkeby --guard <scope_guard_address> --newOwner <new_owner_address>
```

### Enabling the ScopeGuard

One your scope guard is set up, you'll need to call the `setGuard()` function on your GnosisSafe.
You can do this with a custom contract interaction via the [Gnosis Safe UI](http://gnosis-safe.io/) or the [Gnosis Safe CLI](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-cli).

### Deploy a master copy 

The master copy contracts can be deployed through `yarn deploy` command. Note that this only should be done if the Scope Guard contract gets an update and the ones referred on the [zodiac repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/src/factory/constants.ts) should be used.
